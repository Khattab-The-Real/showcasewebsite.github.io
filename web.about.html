My name is Khattab and I have made a lot of things with programming before, I have made Discord bots, applications, and websites. and I made this website just so that I can show people what I can really do, and so that if someone needs help making a website, I will show them this and make a deal on it!</p>
                    <p class="dark">if you are wondering about how many people it took to make this website, well it only took one person, but it took me 1 hour to make this.</p>
